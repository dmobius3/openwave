## PLANNING

### Why this is platform work

The [M8.5-A protocol](../../openwave/xperiments/m8_mit/research/findings/m8_5a_reproduction_protocol.md)
§ 4 specifies a context firewall but not how to build one on a real machine. Answering that
produced a set of decisions that are not about `2I`, the McKay ladder, or anything else in the
M8 column: where the room lives, which tools are withheld, what enters the packet, who audits
it, and what order the commits go in. Every one of those recurs the next time any column owes a
context-isolated reproduction.

The [roadmap's ownership test](../platform_roadmap.md#conventions) splits it cleanly. The
procedure is shared machinery and files here. The M8.5-A result is evidence about one model's
physics and files on the [M8 roadmap](../../openwave/xperiments/m8_mit/research/m8_roadmap.md)
under M8.5-A, where its planning already sits in
[`m8_5_task_details.md`](../../openwave/xperiments/m8_mit/research/tasks/m8_5_task_details.md).

**Deliverable**: `dev_docs/CLEAN_ROOM.md` (written at block F; linked from here when it
exists), a standard written from an exercise rather than in the abstract, in the shape of [`METHOD_NOTE.md`](../METHOD_NOTE.md)
and [`CROSS_MODEL_TESTING.md`](../CROSS_MODEL_TESTING.md). It is written after the first run,
not before, so it records what actually held; if the M8.5-A run refutes the procedure, the
finding is recorded here and no standard ships.

### The name (decided 2026-07-31)

**Clean room**, the term the protocol itself introduced (its § 4: "the packet that enters the
clean room") and an established software-engineering term with decades of precedent: in
clean-room reimplementation, one team writes a specification from the original and a second
team implements from the specification alone, producing provably independent work. That
two-team structure maps onto this procedure exactly, the answer-holding author writes the
protocol, a fresh context implements from the packet alone.

The terms are a ladder, not synonyms, and the standard keeps them distinct:

| Term | What it names |
| --- | --- |
| clean room | the ENVIRONMENT and procedure: the isolated directory, the audited packet, the ordering record. What this standard specifies |
| context firewall | the RULE SET the room enforces (protocol § 4's own heading): fresh context, no quarantined access, no web tools, the manifest |
| context-isolated independent-method reproduction | the CLAIM a successful run earns (protocol § 2), and the ceiling |
| blind | a STRONGER claim the room alone never grants. Blind is a property of what the verifying context has seen, not of the environment; a clean room makes isolation auditable, it cannot erase prior exposure, and for an AI implementer the opaque training corpus caps the label structurally |

The last row is why the procedure is NOT named "blind agent" despite the temptation: this
platform's own standing rule (roadmap CONVENTIONS, M8.2 close-out) reserves blind for runs
whose targets were withheld from a context that had never seen them, and the M8.5-A protocol
explicitly bans the word from its deliverable. A clean room is the machinery a blind run ALSO
uses; the machinery does not make a run blind.

### The room

| Setting | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Location | any directory with no `CLAUDE.md` anywhere on its ancestor path, and outside every repository working tree. The concrete path is a local choice and stays out of the repository |
| Python environment | must not have the platform installed or importable: an editable install makes the quarantined tree reachable through a bare `import` regardless of the room's location, and an environment named after the repository puts that name in the shell prompt. Verify from the room's shell before launch: the `import` fails, `pip show` returns nothing (DEVIATIONS LOG, block B) |
| Launch | `claude --disallowedTools "WebSearch,WebFetch"`, in DEFAULT permission mode. Not a bypass mode: the approval prompt is what makes a tool call reaching outside the room visible to the operator, and it is the one containment guard that does not rely on the implementer's cooperation |
| Write scope | the implementer writes only inside the room and never reaches the repository; a maintainer copies artifacts out and performs every commit |
| Teardown | the room is deleted at the end of the run, block G below. Not before: a rerun under § 3 needs it, it is the only copy until block C has copied the artifacts out, and block F may need to check a detail against it |

**The ancestor-path rule is the load-bearing one, and it is easy to get wrong.** A folder
alongside the repository looks isolated and is not: any `CLAUDE.md` above it loads on the first
turn, before the agent reads a word of the packet. The obvious sibling location for this run
sits under a 7-line `CLAUDE.md` whose entire content instructs the agent to go read the
`openwave` directory, which is the quarantined tree. Nothing in the room's own contents would
have revealed the breach. Check the whole ancestor path, and check what the file says rather
than only whether one exists.

**What loads unavoidably**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, the user-level instructions. It enters the
consulted-files manifest as a disclosed load rather than an unmentioned one. Grep it for the
subject terms before the run, and read the summary of that grep carefully: at block A it came
back free of anything answer-bearing while still naming this repository several times in
unrelated prose (DEVIATIONS LOG). "Nothing relevant" is the conclusion to be most careful with
here, since the file is written for a general working context and nobody edits it with a clean
room in mind. Project memory is keyed to the working directory, so a new folder starts with
none.

### The packet, and who may write it

§ 4 defines the packet as the protocol plus the group input. A maintainer who already knows the
answers is the one assembling it, which is exactly the situation the § 4 audit anticipates. The
containment is that no part of the packet is capable of carrying a target:

| Part | Audit |
| --- | --- |
| `PROTOCOL.md` | a verbatim copy of the frozen protocol, so `diff` against the repository file is the whole audit and no authorship enters |
| `GROUP_INPUT.md` | two generators as unit quaternions, supplied by the model author. The audit is mechanical: closure gives exactly the expected order, and the file carries no labels, dimensions, distances, or character values |
| `TASK.md` | operational instructions only: the added gates, the § 6 declaration, output paths. Its mathematical content is generic identities, not values |

**Generators, not the full element set.** G1 gates group order and closure. Handing over the
complete element set makes G1 true by construction, which is precisely the class of check the
column banned after `m7_trivial_ok`. Handing two generators makes the agent build the closure
and G1 becomes a check that can fail.

**Canonicalize before hashing.** The packet hash is what preserves provenance across the run,
and it is only meaningful if the same group always produces the same bytes. Generator
components are generally irrational, so a supplied decimal rendering fixes a hash to a
transcription rather than to a group. Canonicalization (a declared exact form, or a declared
precision and ordering) happens in block A before the hash is taken, and the canonical form
is what enters the room.

**Implementer eligibility.** Any context that has read the M8.2 generator, the maintainer
reconstruction, or the pre-registration § 6.1 is permanently disqualified, whatever it later
forgets. That includes the session that writes the packet.

**Author-side verification evidence is not the audit.** An author may ship a verification
script and report alongside the packet. It stays outside the room, and it does not discharge
the maintainer audit: an audit that reads the supplier's report and concurs is a review of the
report, not an independent check of the packet. Run the audit from the packet alone, then set
the two results side by side as a cross-check. Where the author states a hash of the delivered
bytes, record it as the INCOMING hash and state whether canonicalization changed it, so the
chain from delivery to room is complete either way.

**Prepared artifacts must outlive the session that wrote them.** The packet's non-supplied
parts are drafted before the run, and a scratch directory is not a home for them:

| Artifact | Home |
| --- | --- |
| `TASK.md` | committed with the packet at block A. Committing it before the room opens is what stops it being read as retrofitted to the outcome |
| the packet audit script and its output | committed with the packet at block A, into the column's `scripts/` and `data/` |
| the opening prompt | § The opening prompt below |

### The opening prompt

The message that starts the clean-room session is deliberately near-empty, because everything
the implementer needs is already in the room:

> Read `PROTOCOL.md`, `TASK.md`, and `GROUP_INPUT.md` in this directory, in that order, then do
> what `TASK.md` says. Everything you need is here; nothing outside this directory is available
> or needed.

Anything beyond this belongs in `TASK.md`, where it enters the audited packet and the commit
record. An instruction delivered as chat text is invisible to the packet hash, absent from the
manifest, and composed by a context holding the targets, which is the one information channel
§ 4 forbids. The near-empty prompt is a firewall property, not a style preference.

### The operator during the run

The human at the room's keyboard is a firewall component, and the standard owes them a
runbook, not just a launch flag. The permission rules (decided at block B, applied live):

| Prompt or event | Operator action |
| --- | --- |
| at launch, before the opening prompt | verify the room's four file hashes against the sealed record; verify the session banner's working directory is the room; record the banner's model for the environment record |
| permission prompt for a path inside the room, or for running the implementation there | approve |
| permission prompt for any path outside the room, or any network call | decline, and log the prompt text in the deviations log |
| no blanket grant | never pre-approve tool classes, never "don't ask again" on file access, never a bypass mode. Each prompt is read before it is answered; the reading is the guard |
| the implementer asks a question | not answered from the operator's knowledge, however innocuous. Relayed to the maintainer session, answered from the protocol text or not at all, logged as a deviation |
| the implementer finishes | its final message is relayed verbatim; nothing in the room is touched until block C copies it out |

The declined prompt is evidence, not just prevention: a room session that ever asked for an
outside path has stated something about its behavior under isolation, and the standard wants
that recorded even when the answer was no.

Remote approval (the operator answering prompts from a phone) is permitted: it relocates the
operator's channel and grants the session nothing. The rules above apply unchanged on any
device, and the two that erode on a small screen are the ones to hold consciously: every
prompt is read in full before it is answered, and a question from the implementer is never
answered from the phone, it is relayed and answered from the protocol text or not at all.

### Running it beside a live maintainer session

The two sessions are independent processes and may run side by side. The information rule is
one-directional:

| Direction | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| clean room → maintainer session | unrestricted. The maintainer session is already disqualified, so nothing is lost by showing it anything |
| maintainer session → clean room | ONLY the audited packet, fixed before launch and not amended mid-run |

If the implementer asks a question mid-run, it is answered from the protocol text or not at
all, and the exchange is recorded as a deviation. Relaying a sentence composed by a context
holding the targets defeats the firewall no matter how innocuous the sentence looks.

### Run plan

| Block | Work | Commit boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | receive the author's generators; audit the packet FROM THE PACKET ALONE (closure to the expected order, no derived annotations, `diff` on the protocol copy); record the incoming author hash, canonicalize, issue the authoritative SHA-256 | the packet, `TASK.md`, the audit script and its output, committed first so the timestamp predates the run |
| B | the clean-room session: implementation, gates, runnable mutation harness, the § 6 module, raw output and JSON | none; the agent writes only inside the room |
| C | copy artifacts out, generate SHA-256, write the environment record and method-note draft | **the § 9 commitment.** Nothing is unsealed before it lands |
| D | unseal; build the § 7 comparison harness with its transcription mutation; adjudicate | second, separately dated commit |
| E | method note per [`METHOD_NOTE.md`](../METHOD_NOTE.md), then the adversarial audit by a second agent | M8.5-A close-out, in the M8 column |
| F | **write the standard**: `dev_docs/CLEAN_ROOM.md` from the deviations log, the failure modes actually hit, and the manifest-against-transcript comparison. Amend or retract whatever this planning doc got wrong | T4 close-out, in `dev_docs/` |
| G | **delete the room.** Keep its session transcript | none |

Blocks A through D are one sitting. Block E is not promised in the same sitting: an adversarial
audit that is rushed to fit a day is not an adversarial audit.

**Block F is the task, not its write-up.** Everything before it produces one model's evidence;
F is the only block that produces platform machinery, and skipping it leaves the procedure as
tribal knowledge in a closed task document. It is deliberately last, because a standard written
before the run records intentions. It is also the block that can conclude the procedure does not
work: per § Why this is platform work, a refutation is recorded here and no standard ships, and
that closes T4 as legitimately as a standard does.

**Block G is a required step, not housekeeping.** A room left on disk is a room that gets
reused, and its second occupant is not context-isolated: the folder holds the packet, the
implementation, and by then the unsealed comparison. Delete it once block F closes, not at E:
the standard is written from the run, and the room is the last place to check a detail the
transcript renders ambiguously.

Keep the session transcript, which lives under the agent's own project-history directory rather
than inside the room, so deleting the room does not touch it. It is worth keeping because it
corroborates the § 4 manifest: the manifest states what the implementer consulted, and the
transcript is the independent record of what it actually opened. A manifest with no way to
check it is an attestation, and this column already ruled against those.

### Suggested definition of done

| # | Item |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | `dev_docs/CLEAN_ROOM.md` exists and is written from the run, not from the plan |
| 2 | It names the failure modes the exercise actually hit, including any this doc did not predict |
| 3 | The ancestor-path check is stated as a procedure a reader can execute, not as advice |
| 4 | It states which parts are protocol-specific to M8.5-A and which any column inherits |
| 5 | It carries the reproduce-vs-derive ceiling ([`PR_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md`](../PR_REVIEW_STANDARDS.md) Gate B, obligations row): the platform reproduces computations to a frozen spec and does not derive on request; a part requiring original derivation is optional and declinable per run, with the § 6 coexact module's `not resolved` verdict as the worked instance |

### Blindspots

| Risk | Guard |
| --- | --- |
| The standard is written from this plan rather than from the run, so it records intentions | block F writes it, after adjudication, with a deviations log kept throughout |
| The M8 evidence lands, attention moves on, and block F never runs | F carries its own commit boundary and its own close-out, so T4 stays open on the roadmap until the standard exists or a refutation is recorded |
| A future room is placed by copying the path rather than applying the rule | the standard leads with the ancestor-path check and the sibling-folder near-miss that motivated it |
| The packet audit becomes a rubber stamp because the same person assembles and audits | each part has a mechanical audit (`diff`, closure count) rather than a judgment call |
| Withholding web tools is mistaken for an offline requirement | the standard states plainly that the network stays up and only the search tools are withheld |

### Ownership + gating

**Gated by**: the M8.5-A packet being ready. No author reply is required: the packet's group
input is forced by protocol § 5.3, and the fallback for unanswered provenance is recorded in
[`m8_5_task_details.md`](../../openwave/xperiments/m8_mit/research/tasks/m8_5_task_details.md).

## DEVIATIONS LOG

Kept from block A onward, and the raw material block F writes the standard from. Each entry is
what actually happened, including where this plan was wrong.

**2026-07-31, block A. The unavoidable user-level `CLAUDE.md` names the repository, and
§ The room understated it.** That section records the file as grepped for the subject terms
with nothing relevant found. Re-run at block A, the grep is accurate on targets and generous in
its summary: the file carries no group theory, no character or distance data, nothing
answer-bearing, and it names this repository four times in unrelated prose about writing style
and project orientation. It does not hand over an answer, and it does shorten the distance
between the room and a tree the implementer is forbidden to read.

**The same entry, sharpened: the room is isolated by withheld tools and by instruction, not by
a sandbox.** Web search and fetch are withheld, which closes the network route. The local
filesystem is not closed: the implementer has a shell and the quarantined tree is on the same
disk. This plan never claimed otherwise, and it never said it out loud either, which is the
kind of gap a standard exists to close. Three guards, added at block A:

| Guard | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `TASK.md` states the boundary as an obligation | the room is the implementer's whole world by rule, with the out-of-room read named as recoverable and its concealment named as not. An unstated rule cannot be honored or breached |
| the room session runs in default permission mode | any tool call reaching outside the room surfaces as an approval prompt to the operator, who declines it and logs it here. This is the guard that does not depend on the implementer |
| the transcript is checked against `manifest.md` at block C | already planned as the manifest's corroboration; the out-of-room question is now something it is explicitly checked for |

**2026-07-31, block A. The group order is withheld, tighter than protocol § 4 permits.** The
protocol allows supplying 120 as a construction input. `GROUP_INPUT.md` withholds it so G1
stays falsifiable, and says so in the file, so silence does not read as an incomplete packet.

**2026-07-31, block A. Canonicalization turned out to be a no-op.** § The packet anticipated
irrational components arriving as decimals, where a hash would pin a transcription. The author
supplied exact `Q(φ)` arithmetic instead, and the delivered bytes were already canonical under
the declared form, so the incoming and authoritative hashes are identical. The canonicalization
step still ran and is still recorded: the chain from delivery to room has to be complete
whether or not it moved.

**2026-07-31, block A. The mutation suite caught a defect in the audit, not in the packet.**
The leakage check ran last and was skipped whenever an earlier format check aborted the
sequence, so a stray key carrying a target reddened the audit for the wrong reason. Fixed by
computing the leakage scan first and appending it unconditionally. Worth carrying into the
standard: the mutation suite earned its place by failing something.

**2026-07-31, block B. The Python environment is part of the room, and the plan never said
so.** Caught live at launch: the shell arrived in the room with a conda environment active
whose site-packages carry this platform as an installed package, making the quarantined tree
importable from inside the room through a bare `import`, its path discoverable through
`pip show`, and the repository named in the shell prompt itself. The ancestor-path rule
covers what loads by instruction; the interpreter is a second, independent route into the
quarantined tree, and checking one says nothing about the other. Requirement for the
standard: before launch, the active environment must not have the platform installed or
importable, verified mechanically from the room's shell (`import` fails, `pip show` returns
nothing), and the interpreter, versions, and available numerics libraries are recorded for
the environment record. This run switched to the conda base environment, verified clean:
the platform not importable, numerics and exact-arithmetic libraries present.

**2026-07-31, block A/B, adjacent catch. A notification is not a record, and an edit is not
a notification.** The block A audit reply was landed by editing a merged PR's body, which
notifies nobody, and a mention added by edit does not notify either. The question that needed
an answer was then re-sent as a new comment on the delivery thread, which does notify. For
the standard's communications note: the PR body is the durable record, a new comment is the
notification, and anything requiring a human's answer goes in a new comment.
