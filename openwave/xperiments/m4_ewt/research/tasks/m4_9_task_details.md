# M4.9 - Emergent Encoding from Lattice Dynamics

## Status
DONE (post-hoc)

## Criterion
`Gravity: local metric phenomena` — foundational encoding derivation

## Objective
Show in-platform that the two metric encodings used in M4.3–M4.5 emerge
from lattice dynamics without being assumed.

The required encodings are:

- \(n_\gamma \propto \eta^{-1/2}\)
- \(v_{\text{clock}} \propto \sqrt{\eta}\)

## Method

1. Define the microscopic pair potential \(V(r)=V_0/r\).
2. Derive the lattice stiffness from
   \(k(\eta)=d^2V/dr^2|_{r=1/\eta}\).
3. Keep the mass per lattice site fixed at \(m_0\).
4. Use physical wave speed
   \(v_{\text{phys}}=a(\eta)\sqrt{k/m_0}\).
5. Measure the wave-speed exponent \(\beta\).
6. Derive the oscillator-frequency exponent from
   \(f=v_{\text{phys}}/L\).

## Result

- Stiffness exponent: \(\alpha = 3.000002\)
- Wave-speed exponent: \(\beta = 0.501714\)
- Oscillator exponent: \(\gamma = 0.501714\)

All three are consistent with the expected values.

## Interpretation

The encodings are emergent. They are derived from the corrected
microscopic lattice dynamics.
